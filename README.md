Project Title: RTSP Stream Manager - Frontend

Description:
-------------
This is the frontend of a full-stack RTSP Stream Viewer application built using React. It serves as a CRUD interface for managing RTSP links, interacts with a Django REST API backend, and enables live video streaming using video.js.

Key Features:
--------------
1. 📋 Add, view, and edit RTSP stream links via a clean and responsive UI.
2. 🔁 Live stream view page using the `video.js` player for seamless HLS video playback.
3. ⚠️ Real-time error and warning messages to notify users of invalid links or streaming issues.
4. ⏯️ Streaming begins automatically once HLS segments are received from the backend.

Tech Stack:
------------
- React (with Hooks)
- Axios (for API communication)
- React Router (for navigation)
- video.js (for HLS playback)
- Bootstrap / Tailwind CSS (optional, for styling)

Setup Instructions:
--------------------
1. Clone the repository:
   git clone <your_frontend_repo_url>
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   cd frontend
3. Install dependencies:
   npm install
4. Start the development server:
   npm start

Configuration:
---------------
- Update the `.env` or config file with your backend API base URL.
- Example:
  REACT_APP_BACKEND_URL=http://localhost:8000/api/

Folder Structure (Simplified):
-------------------------------
- /src
  ├── components/       # CRUD components and video player
  ├── pages/            # Route-specific views
  ├── api/              # Axios service for backend communication
  └── App.js            # Main application logic and routes

Notes:
-------
- The frontend expects valid HLS (m3u8) links for streaming. These are generated by the backend.
- MJPEG over WebSocket playback can be supported via a secondary frontend component if needed.
